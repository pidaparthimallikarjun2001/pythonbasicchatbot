"""
This is a chatbot which helps you to manage your physical and mental fitness as well. 
If the user selects mental fitness, it motivates the user by telling a random quote and it also tells us some ways to overcome fear and depression.
If the user selects physical fitness, 
it asks for 2 things: 1. Exercise and 2. Diet plan
In both these cases, it asks the user to enter his weight(in kgs) and height(in cms) and it calculates his/her BMI(Body Mass Index)
According to his / her BMI, the bot tells us what to eat and what exercise to do in order to be healthy both physically and mentally.
